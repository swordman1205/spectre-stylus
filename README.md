# Stylus Version of Spectre.css
Spectre.css is a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework for faster and extensible development. [Stylus.css](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre)

This stylus version converts less to stylus for better integration with your stylus project and allows you to use stylus mixins and @extends to create, for example, additional buttons, labels etc.

### Scope
This is a minimual less->stylus conversion. 

Syntax for variables and mixins has been converted, but the syntax remains css-like and does not adopt stylus' minimal syntax. This has been done to reduce the effort when the less project updates.

### Documentation
For framework documentation, see original [Stylus.css](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre) project.
